# Data-Analysis-of-the-World-Happiness-Report-from-2015-to-2021.
The goal of this project is to show that I can collect, manipulate, and clean a data set. For this project I have downloaded and cleaned the World Happiness Reports of 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. After cleaning all the reports I have created a new Data set that has each country's happiness report from 2015 to 2021 for future data analysis projects.  

•	This project is completed with the help of pandas package installed on Python 3.8 and PyCharm IDE.
•	The World_Happiness_Report_cleaned.csv will be automatically produced by dataCleaning.py
•	Please see the details in dataCleaningReport.pdf for the better understanding of World_Happiness_Report_cleaned.csv
